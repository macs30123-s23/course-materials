    "## Introduction to Boto3 and AWS Serverless Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that we wanted to detect objects in an image, extract text from images. We could write and train our own classifiers, run our classifier on a server (e.g. an EC2 instance) and use this to make predictions. This requires a lot of time and energy in selecting the appropriate hardware, software, techniques, etc. necessary to perform these operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, all the major cloud providers offer serverless \"functions as a service\" which are pre-trained/coded models that you simply need to provide data to and you will receive a response. Your cloud provider (e.g. AWS) will spin up the compute instances necessary to actually run the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can access all of these through the AWS Console, but it is easier to integrate them into your existing code via the Boto3 SDK."

    "## Using AWS Lambda to make HTTP Requests in Parallel\n",
    "\n",
    "A common task for computational social scientists is making HTTP requests to access and process web data. It can be quite limiting to make these requests serially, though. When we do, the amount of data we are able to collect is limited both by our internet bandwidth and machine's ability to sequentially process the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be much better to parallelize this workflow. Here, we'll take a look at how we could do this in a serverless fashion using the same workflow as above (Mapping Data to Lambda Functions via Step Functions). Specifically, we will call the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started) in parallel on a list of ISBNs (one API call can be constructed [like this](https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=isbn:1906523371)), calculating the number of words used in the description for each book in our ISBN list (see workflow below). Word count is a simple metric (used here as a proof-of-concept), but it would also be possible to perform other Natural Language Processing routines using this same approach. Such a cloud workflow allows us to gather and process far greater amounts of data than would be otherwise possible on our local machines.\n",

    "The only tricky thing with running this particular code as a Lambda function is that we are importing in the `requests` module in order to make HTTP requests. Such dependencies are not included by default in Lambda's Python runtimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to work with dependencies, we'll need to package our Lambda Function with all of its dependencies (which you can do manually [like so](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-package.html#python-package-create-package-with-dependency) or by adding a [predefined \"layer\" defined by a 3rd-party](https://api.klayers.cloud//api/v2/p3.9/layers/latest/us-east-1/html) via its ARN in the Lambda dashboard). Note as well that [you also can work with Docker container images](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-image.html) (AWS provides up-to-date base images for Lambda) to test and upload your function to AWS. The Docker approach is not necessary for any of the assignments in the class, but you may need to explore this option in your final project if you are working with Lambda functions that get too big to upload through the Lambda interface directly (i.e. if you're working with an especially big model, or large software not already installed on Lambda).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the manual workflow linked above, we have included a zipped version of the Lambda function (with its dependencies) in this directory (`word_count.zip`) that you can upload and use (**walk through directory structure live in class**). You'll need to do the same if you want to provide added functionality to your Lambda functions (e.g. `BeautifulSoup` for web-scraping, `numpy` or `pandas` for analytical workflows, etc.). We'll also need to increase our lambda timeout so that we have enough time for our program to run to perform longer running jobs (the default is a 3s timeout).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use `boto3` this time to create our Lambda Function from our zipped `word_count.zip` (to demonstrate that we can do this programmatically as well as in the console as we did earlier):"

    "This is ~20x faster than the serial solution (meaning we can gather more data in the same amount of time, re: Gustafson's Law!). If we ran this same code on larger sets of ISBNs in a personal account, we would expect our compute time to remain similar, so long as we stay beneath the 3000 concurrent Lambda invocation maximum.\n",

    "So, we can quickly parallelize workflows in a serverless fashion using a combination of AWS Lambda and Step Functions. You can also create even more complicated workflows in Step Functions involving functional decomposition, multiple layers of Lambda function invocations, and more.\n",

    "One thing to note with the workflow above is that the payload size for inputs and outputs is not infinite (Step Functions will only accept inputs and outputs of size [262 KB or less](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/avoid-exec-failures.html)). So, if you are working with really big inputs and/or outputs, you will want to input data from AWS cloud databases/distributed storage systems (e.g. providing the keys to the data you're referencing in the input JSON) and output data to a database/storage system within your Lambda function invocation as well. We'll talk more about how you can work with cloud databases (which allow you to make many concurrent reads and writes) next week to enable this increased scalability."
